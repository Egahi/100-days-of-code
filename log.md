### Day 3: January 13th, 2018

### Day 9; January 19th, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Python for web! found my way into the world of python.
**Thoughts**: Python's syntax is almost plain text! I see why it is preferred to C.


### Day 10: January 20th, 2018

### Day 12: January 22nd, 2018
**Today's progress**: Walked a friend through implementing some projects and helped another debug his code.
**Thoughts**: Debugging is so much fun when you spot the errors in seconds, else...
