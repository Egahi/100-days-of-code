Algorithm
0. Prompt user to input triangle dimensions, a, b, c
1. if a is greater than c
	swap the values of a and c
2. else if b is greater than c
	swap the values of b and c
3. If the triagle dimensions obey pythagoras theorem
	It is a right ngle triangle
4. else
	It is not
5. circumference = a + b + c
6. s = (a + b + c) / 2
7. Area = squareroot of (s * (s - a)  * (s - b) * (s -  c))
8. exit
